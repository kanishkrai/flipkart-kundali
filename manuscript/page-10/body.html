        <h2> Flipkart vs. Amazon</h2>
        <p>
            Flipkart and Amazon are the two juggernauts fighting for the top spot in the Indian e-commerce space. As per charts Flipkart is likely to perform better than Amazon for a few years, specifically until there is transit of Saturn in Amazon's chart.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the next two years Flipkart will have an upperhand on almost every aspect of business over Amazon, but the latter will also grow slowly and steadily. This means that Flipkart might get to a higher turnover than Amazon-India would but the deep rivalry between them will continue for many years to come. In general, both Flipkart and Amazon have a good position of Mercury so growth of business would never be an issue for either of them. </p>
        <p> Not surprisingly, there is also a favorable dasha that Flipkart will enter the US/European market to give Amazon a run for the money in their own home turf. </p>
