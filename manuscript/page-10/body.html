        <h2> Flipkart vs Amazon</h2>
        
        <p> Now if we compare Flipkart with with Amazon upto then we would say that Flipkart will see higher rise than Amazon for the next two years as dhaiya of Saturn is going on them. So losses are indicated for Amazon. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In these two years, Flipkart will get success with fast moves and Amazon will work slowly and steadily. A higher turnover is expected for Flipkart than Amazon this year. Both Flipkart and Amazon have good position of Mercury so they will see so much rise. But later in life, Amazon will also get the support from Indian government.</p>
