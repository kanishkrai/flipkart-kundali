        <h2> Flipkart vs Amazon</h2>
        
        <p> Flipkart and Amazon are two big juggernauts fighting in same eCommerce space in India. Flipkart would perform with higher growth rates than Amazon, due to some specific transit of Saturn in Amazon's chart.

        <p>
        So in the next two years, Flipkart will have an upperhand in terms of performance and traction over Amazon, which will grow slowly and steadily. This also means Flipkart would have higher turnover than Amazon. In general, both Flipkart and Amazon have good position of Mercury, so growth would never be an issue for them. Later in life, Flipkart will also get the support from Indian government for further expansion.</p>
