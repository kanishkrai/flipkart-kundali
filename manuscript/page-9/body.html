        <h2> Snapdeal's Acquisition </h2>
        <p> According to Flipkart's chart Jupiter will transit to the 3<sup>rd</sup> house and will aspect the 7<sup>th</sup> house of mergers and acquisitions, 9<sup>th</sup> house of fortune and luck and the 11<sup>th</sup> house of profits and achievement. In short, there is great success in merger between Flipkart and Snapdeal which will eventually bring more firepower and good luck to the company. </p>
        <p>Saturn antardasha and Saturn's transit from 7th house during the year 2017 will be very rewarding for Flipkart as they will see both a steep growth in business and benefits from partnerships with allies.
        </p>
        <p>During this timeframe Flipkart will face few hurdles and in general the merger will act as a catalyst for them to one-up their rivals securing the top position. More acquisitions are possible, both locally and in the international markets. </p>
