        <h2> Flipkart IPO & Future</h2>
        <p>
            There is a good chance of Flipkart going public between February to August, 2018 as Saturn transits into 5th house of speculations/shares. As per India's chart, Rahu will transit in 3<sup>rd</sup> house of communication roughly at the same time indicating a major milestone for the Indian startup ecosystem—a good time for a startup looking for venture money!
        </p>
        <p>
            During September, 2017 to September, 2018 planet Jupiter will transit through the 6<sup>th</sup> house of service, i.e. the sign of Libra—the great balancer. During this period new startups will sprout that will compete with focus on quality of their services and usability, tipping a balance in favor of a competitive market. Shortly afterwards, Jupiter will also transit through 7<sup>th</sup> house of clandestine partnerships, a sunsign of Scorpio—leading to secret tie-ups and latent syndications to pursue hidden agendas.
