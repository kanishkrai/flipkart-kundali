        <h2> Current Position </h2>

        <p> Sun is Swagrahi in the Ascendant House of a Chart, witnessing great growth and development in the organization. Given such a planetary configuration, the employees are likely to show solidarity to the company. The management and the workers enjoy healthy and cordial relations. This position of the Sun ushers in an over all prosperity for the organization.</p>

        <p>However, as a negative factor, Saturn-Ketu are present in a combination in the Ascendant House of Flipkart’s Chart, which weakens Sun’s positive influence. This kind of planetary alignment is known to produce tendencies of indiscipline, discontentment and turbulence among the workers. This may also lead to detractors and rivals, hurting the organization’s prospects.</p>
