        <h2> Current Dasha </h2>

        <p> Sun is Swagrahi in the Ascendant House of their chart, promising great strides and growth in business, right from the very beginning. Such a planetary configuration is both rare and helps in finding a team or employees who dispel solidarity with the company. The management and the workers will mostly enjoy healthy and cordial relations. Position of Sun ushers an overall prosperity for the organization.</p>

        <p>On the flip side however, both Saturn and Ketu are present in conjunction with the Ascendant House of Flipkart’s Chart, weakening Sun’s positive influence to a certain extent. This kind of planetary alignment is known for dissatisfaction among some workers but will not lead them to join rivals hurting the organization’s own prospects. Overall, a very strong future and upperhand in ecommerce.</p>
