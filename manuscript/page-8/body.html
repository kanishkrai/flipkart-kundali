        <h2> Foreign expansion </h2>
        <p> Flipkart has a strong foundation but a weak dasha for international expansion. It will continue to struggle on its international strategy owing to Saturn-Ketuâ€™s adverse position in its First House.</p>

        <p> The Rahu is expected to move into 12<sup>th</sup> house by August 2017 following which, due to Rahu's movement away from the Sun, their outlook for international expansion may get a little positive. It is generally recommended for Flipkart to take a look at competing in international markets. </p>

        <p>As Rahu moves into 12th house of foreign lands, the company may want to deal in foreign markets or seal a solid partnership with an overseas company to expand its global stronghold. There is also a high probability of change in the brandname as the company explores its international take.</p>
